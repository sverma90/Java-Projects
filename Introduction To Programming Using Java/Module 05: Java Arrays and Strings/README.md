# Assignment 5

<p>Morse code, developed in 1832 by Samuel Morse, is one of the most famous of all coding schemes ever developed. Morse code assigns a series of dots and dashes to each letter of the alphabet, each digit, and a few other punctuation characters. </p>

<p>This project involves writing a program to translate Morse code into English and English into Morse code. Your program shall prompt the user to specify the desired type of translation, input a string of Morse code characters or English characters, then display the translated results. The Morse code pattern and English letter translations must be kept and processed using either two one-dimensional or one two-dimensional arrays.</p>

<p>When you input Morse code, separate each letter/digit with a single space, and delimit multiple words with a “|”. For example, - --- | -... . would be the Morse code input for the sentence “to be”. Your program only needs to handle a single sentence and can ignore punctuation symbols.</p>

<p>When you input English, separate each word with a blank space. Be sure to comment your code and use good programming style.</p>
