<p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health that is based on a person’s weight and height. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of a person’s height (in meters). Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight (in pounds) and a height (in inches) and then displays the BMI. Note that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters. The program should also display the following BMI information from the Department of Health & Human Services/National Institutes of Health so a user can evaluate his/her BMI:</p>
