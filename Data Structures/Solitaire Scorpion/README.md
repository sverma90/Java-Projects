# Solitaire Scorpion

<p><b>Data Structure used:</b> Linked List</p>

<p>Write a program to implement a Solitaire Scorpion card game by using some kind of linked list structure.  The computer should play the game, not you.  It is not required that the program select the optimal moves each time. You should print out every move, including when the reserve is dealt, when a column is filled or when a card is turned face-up.</p>
